In Silico Study of Doxorubicin Molecular Docking on Topoisomerase II Enzyme

This project presents an **in silico molecular docking study** of the anticancer drug **Doxorubicin** targeting the **Topoisomerase II (Top2A) enzyme**, a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and transcription. The goal of this study is to analyze the binding interaction, energy profiles, and potential inhibitory mechanisms of Doxorubicin using computational docking tools.

### Tools Used:  
- UCSF Chimera  
- Avogadro  
- PyMOL  
- ADT 
- openBabel 
- castp server 

### Objectives:
- Structural preparation of the ligand and target  
- Electrostatic potential mapping  
- Molecular docking simulation  
- Energy analysis and interpretation  

This research contributes to understanding how Doxorubicin interacts with Topoisomerase II at the molecular level, supporting drug design efforts in cancer therapy.
