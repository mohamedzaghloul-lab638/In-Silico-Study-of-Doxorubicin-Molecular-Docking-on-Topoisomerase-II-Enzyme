# In-Silico-Study-of-Doxorubicin-Molecular-Docking-on-Topoisomerase-II-Enzyme
This project presents an in silico molecular docking study of the anticancer drug Doxorubicin targeting the Topoisomerase II (Top2A) enzyme, a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and transcription. The goal of this study is to analyze the binding interaction, energy profiles, and potential inhibitory mechanisms of Doxorubicin
